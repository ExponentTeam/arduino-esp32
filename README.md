# Arduino and esp32 code for CarProtector project
This code was written by Androsiuk Maksym, student of ["Internet of Things"](http://iot.lviv.ua) programm in Lviv Polytechnic National University. With the help of this code camera can stream on the server, make get requsts and receive data from arduino. Arduino can read data from sensors and send them to esp32.

## Instalation and execution
1. Download code and open it with Arduino IDE editor
2. If you want run arduino code, then just connect it via adapter and press "Upload" button
3. If you want run esp32 code, then connect esp32 with FTDI-converter and connect it all to the computer and press "Upload" button. When code is compiled, press restart button on arduino for 2 seconds
4. Connect arduino and esp32 vi TX RX and now they work properly.
